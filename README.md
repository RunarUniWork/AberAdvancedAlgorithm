# AberAdvancedAlgorithm
This is a repo for my assignment for the module Advanced Algorithms (CS31920). Where the task was to automatically solve a flow game, where the goal is to connect pairs of colors on a grid.,

Not all code is mine, assignment focused on linear programming, therefor code to basic setup code is not mine.

#Library needed
GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit)

#How to run
To compile:
gcc -Wall puzzleSolver.c -lglpk

Run:
./a.out ${Path2Board}
